## 📧 Cold Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Auto Repair Shops

**Subject**: Quick question about your safety data sheets

**Email**:
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Shop Name] on Google and saw you handle [oil/coolant/brake fluid] regularly.

Quick question: How do you currently organize your safety data sheets for OSHA compliance?

Most auto shops I talk to are either:
• Using a messy binder that never gets updated
• Scrambling when the inspector shows up
• Paying $200+/month for overkill compliance software

I built SafetyDatas specifically for small shops like yours - $15/month, simple PDF upload, instant QR codes for your wall.

Worth a 10-minute chat to see if it fits?

[Calendar Link] or just reply here.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Happy to send over a 30-day free trial link if you want to test it first.
```

### Template 2: Bike Shops

**Subject**: SDS compliance for [Shop Name]

**Email**:
```
Hey [Name],

Love what you're doing at [Shop Name]! Been following your shop for a bit.

I help small workshops manage their safety data sheets without the enterprise software headache.

For bike shops specifically, I know you deal with:
• Cleaning solvents
• Lubricants and greases
• Tubeless sealants
• Brake fluids

All of these need SDS on file. SafetyDatas lets you:
✓ Upload PDFs in seconds
✓ Generate QR codes for your workshop wall
✓ Print compliance binders automatically
✓ Access from any device

$15/month. 14-day free trial.

### Template 3: Skin Clinics / Med Spas

**Subject**: FDA compliance question for [Clinic Name]

**Email**:
```
Hi [Name],

I'm working with several med spas on simplifying their product documentation compliance.

Question: How does [Clinic Name] currently track safety data sheets for your skincare products and cleaning chemicals?

Most clinics I speak with are:
• Missing documentation for half their products
• Storing everything in a filing cabinet nobody checks
• Worried about what happens during an inspection

I built SafetyDatas to solve this - specifically for small clinics that don't need expensive enterprise software.

Features that matter for you:
• Upload any PDF instantly
• Organize by treatment room or product type
• Generate QR codes for quick access
• Print professional compliance reports
• $15/month, cancel anytime

Worth a quick look?

Or happy to answer any questions via email.

Best,

### Template 4: Hair Salons

**Subject**: OSHA compliance made simple for salons

**Email**:
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question about [Salon Name]'s compliance setup:

With all the hair color, bleach, and cleaning products you use daily - how do you currently organize your safety data sheets?

I ask because most salons I work with were either:
• Missing required documentation
• Using outdated paper binders
• Paying way too much for complicated software

I built SafetyDatas specifically for small businesses like yours:

✨ $15/month (not $200+)
✨ Upload PDFs in seconds
✨ Generate QR codes for your color bar
✨ Print compliance binders automatically
✨ 14-day free trial

Want to see if it's a fit for [Salon Name]?

SafetyDatas.com

P.S. - I can also help you find missing SDS sheets if you need them. Just send me a list of your main products.
```

### Template 5: Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Subject**: Re: [Original Subject]

**Email**:
```
Hey [Name],

Quick follow-up on my email about safety data sheet management.

I know compliance isn't the most exciting topic, but getting caught without proper documentation can mean:
• OSHA fines ($1,000-$10,000+)
• Failed inspections
• Insurance issues

Just want to make sure you have this handled - even if it's not with SafetyDatas.

If you're already sorted, just reply "all good" and I'll stop following up.

If not, happy to send over that free trial link.

**Template 1: The Compliance Reminder**
```
If your small business uses any chemicals, you need safety data sheets on file.

Not optional.

OSHA can show up unannounced and fine you $1,000-$10,000+ for missing documentation.

I built a simple tool to help small shops stay compliant without the enterprise software headache.

$15/month. 14-day free trial.

```

**Template 2: The Relatable Problem**
```
POV: The OSHA inspector just asked for your safety data sheets

You: *opens dusty binder from 2019*

Inspector: "These are all expired"

You: 😰

Don't let this be you.

```

**Template 3: The Quick Win**
```
Tired of managing safety data sheets in a binder?

Try this instead:

1. Upload PDF to SafetyDatas
2. Generate QR code
3. Tape QR code to your wall
4. Done

Now anyone can access your SDS instantly by scanning.

Takes 30 seconds per document.

```

**Template 4: The Comparison**
```
Enterprise compliance software: $200+/month, 6-month contract, requires training

SafetyDatas: $15/month, month-to-month, intuitive enough for your mom to use

Same compliance. Same protection. 93% less money.

Built for small businesses, not Fortune 500.

```

**Template 5: The Story**
```
Last week a customer told me they got hit with a $3,500 OSHA fine for missing safety data sheets.

They had the sheets.

They just couldn't find them when the inspector showed up.

Paper binders fail when you need them most.

Go digital. Go searchable. Go QR codes.

Your future self will thank you.
