# SMB COLD OUTREACH PLAN - SafetyDatas

## Target Industries

### 1. Auto Repair Shops
**Pain Points:**
- Legally required to maintain SDS for all chemicals (brake fluid, coolant, solvents)
- OSHA inspections = heavy fines for non-compliance
- Paper binders get messy, lost, or outdated
- No easy way to search/find specific sheets during emergency

**Decision Maker:** Shop owner, Service manager
**Target Geo:** Local/regional focus (start with your area)

**Cold Email Template:**
```
Subject: Quick question about your safety data sheets

Hi {Name},

I help auto repair shops get OSHA-compliant on their safety data sheets without the binder chaos.

Most shops I talk to are still using paper folders that get lost or are 3 years out of date. That's a $13,653 fine per violation if OSHA shows up.

We built a simple tool that:
- Uploads all your SDS PDFs in minutes
- Auto-generates an alphabetical index
- Creates print-ready binders for inspections
- Lets you search by chemical name instantly

Worth a 5-min chat to see if it fits your shop?

### 2. Bike Shops
**Pain Points:**
- Handle degreasers, lubricants, tire sealants (all need SDS)
- Small staff = no time for paperwork
- Often don't realize they're required to have SDS on file
- Chain locations = distributed compliance nightmare

**Decision Maker:** Store manager, Regional operations

**Cold Email Template:**
```
Subject: Are your bike shops OSHA-ready?

Hi {Name},

Quick question: Do all your locations have current safety data sheets for your degreasers and tire sealants?

Most bike shops don't realize they're required to maintain SDS for every chemical on site. One OSHA inspection can result in fines that wipe out a month's profit.

We built SafetyDatas specifically for small shops that need compliance without the admin overhead:
- Upload all sheets in one batch
- Automatic A-Z index generation
- Print-ready for inspectors
- Search any chemical in 2 seconds

Are your locations currently managing this manually, or do you have a system in place?

### 3. Skin Clinics / Medical Spas
**Pain Points:**
- Chemical peels, sterilizers, cleaning agents all require SDS
- Medical compliance + OSHA = double scrutiny
- Staff turnover = lost institutional knowledge
- Need quick access for emergency responders

**Decision Maker:** Clinic owner, Practice manager

**Cold Email Template:**
```
Subject: SDS compliance for {Clinic Name}

Hi {Name},

Running a clinic means juggling patient care, staff, and compliance. One area that often falls through the cracks: safety data sheets.

If a chemical spill happens or OSHA inspects, you need instant access to SDS for every product on site—from chemical peels to sterilizing agents.

We built a HIPAA-aware tool that:
- Centralizes all your SDS in one secure location
- Creates inspection-ready indexes
- Lets staff search by product name instantly
- Generates compliance reports

Is SDS management something your clinic has covered, or is it on the "deal with it later" list?

### 4. Hair Stylists / Salons
**Pain Points:**
- Hair dyes, bleaches, straighteners = tons of chemicals
- Often independent contractors = who's responsible?
- Small spaces = higher exposure risk
- Rarely have organized SDS systems

**Decision Maker:** Salon owner, Independent stylists (bulk approach)

**Cold Email Template:**
```
Subject: Keeping {Salon Name} compliant (2 min read)

Hi {Name},

Every hair color, bleach, and treatment product in your salon requires a safety data sheet on file. Most salons don't know this until OSHA shows up.

The fines start at $13,653 per violation—and they add up fast.

We built SafetyDatas to make compliance dead simple:
- Upload all your product sheets in minutes
- Auto-generates an alphabetical binder
- Search any product instantly
- Print-ready for inspections

Do you currently have all your SDS organized, or would this save you some headache?

## Response Handling

### If They Say "We're Good"
```
No worries! Just to clarify—are you using a digital system or paper binders?

If it's paper, happy to show you how shops are cutting their admin time by 80%.
If not, I'll leave you be.
```

### If They Ask About Price
```
Starter plan is $15/month—roughly the cost of one coffee per week.

Professional is $45/month if you have multiple locations or need team access.

Both have a free trial so you can test it with your actual sheets first.
```

### If They're Interested
```
Great! I can walk you through a 5-min demo this week.

When works better—Tuesday or Thursday?
